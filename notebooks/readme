# Battery Data Preprocessing Pipeline

A standardized pipeline for preprocessing battery datasets to extract features for SoH, RUL, and SoC prediction.

## Features

- **Automatic Feature Extraction**: Maps varying column names to 6 standardized features:
  - Capacity, Voltage, Current, Temperature, Discharge Time, Charge Time
- **Missing Value Handling**: Multiple strategies (mean, median, drop, forward fill)
- **Multiple Formats**: Supports CSV, Excel, Parquet, JSON
- **Analysis Tools**: Statistics, correlations, and visualizations

## Files

- `battery_feature_mapper.py` - Maps dataset columns to standardized features
- `data_loader.py` - Loads and processes battery datasets  
- `Battery_Feature_Extraction.ipynb` - Main preprocessing notebook

## Usage

1. Place your battery dataset in the folder
2. Open `Battery_Feature_Extraction.ipynb`
3. Set file path and prediction target (SoH/RUL/SoC)
4. Run all cells
5. Use exported features for model training

## Output

- Cleaned features ready for ML models
- Feature mapping documentation
- Data quality reports and visualizations
